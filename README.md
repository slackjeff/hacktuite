**The TRUE Decentralized Static Microblog, write in Shell Bash** .

## What? :tw-1f4cc:
Are you tired of the great microblogging social media that is exploiting you? Do you just want to share some thought, somewhere simple, without these big companies getting your data?
Or do you want to go back to the past, where you were looking for what you would like to read without throwing anything in your face?
HackTUITE was written for this purpose, fully decentralized and minimalist. You host your own html page on your own server.
